# Brandis: End-to-end encryption for everyone

Try online: https://brandis.io

This app is intended to illustrate the ease with which secure, end-to-end
encryption can be provided using a small amount of JavaScript code in modern
web browsers. Brandis does not implement encryption itself; rather, it relies
on the Web Crypto APIs that are provided by your browser, and simply exposes a
user interface to these APIs that enable their use by non-programmers.

To get started, generate a public/private keypair using the button at the top,
and follow the instructions from there.

The source code for this app is in the public domain, and can be accessed on
GitHub. It is recommended that you download this page to your computer and use
it offline. If you're a programmer, you can inspect the source code itself for
the absence of backdoors.

Note: Currently this app only works on the latest desktop versions of Firefox,
Google Chrome, and Microsoft Edge.
